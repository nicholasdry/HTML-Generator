# HTML-Generator
A GUI application which creates HTML files for the users without them having to write any code.

Version 1.0.0


# User Interface

The program allows the user to update the file constantly as the window is open instead of having to close and create a new file itself.

# Webpage Style

HTML Generator creates a simple static webpage like this.

# Code Style

The code is created linearly as you would create in an actual HTML file. With no added comments or mess except for one copyright.

# Future Developments

Currently the things I would like to add into this project is:
- The ability to add a CSS file to it to provide a nicer webpage result rather than a static webpage.
- Linking of a javascript file.
- Tabbing of the code.
- Ability to add more elements and move them around as opposed to the linear output like I have implemented so far.
