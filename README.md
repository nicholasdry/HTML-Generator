# HTML-Generator
A GUI application which creates HTML files for the users without them having to write any code.

Version 1.1.0

# New Additions: Friday March 23rd, 2016
- Ability to link CSS and JS files
- Ability to input your own HTML formatting inside of the main text area.

# User Interface

The program allows the user to update the file constantly as the window is open instead of having to close and create a new file itself.

# Webpage Style

HTML Generator creates a simple static webpage like this.

# Code Style

The code is created linearly as you would create in an actual HTML file. With no added comments or mess except for one copyright.

# Future Developments

Currently the things I would like to add into this project is:
- Tabbing of the code.
- Ability to add more elements and move them around as opposed to the linear output like I have implemented so far.
- Ability to create CSS stylesheets.
- Ability to create simple javascript.
